Websites are an esential part of every business - be it a blog, a website that presents your business or a landing page. It's purpose is very simple - drive traffic and bring exposure to the things you're working on. It's a powerful tool for you to help you in your jurney to success.

Okay, we know what is a website and why we need it...but how do we create one.

Nowadays, there's a lot of ways to make a website:

1. Use tools (website builder platforms) that already exist in the market and help you set it up in a matter of minutes, 
2. Create it yourself
3. Use different types of software technologies (you need technical skills for this) 
4. Hire a professional to do it for you (I do not advise using this option).

In this post, we're going to explore the first option - I'm going to describe what you will need before you start creating a website and I will present different platform which I think are great for builidng beautiful websites fast.

## 1. Choose a domain name

---

Wherever you see website builder platform saying "Build a website for free" or a related title, what exactly means is - yes, you can build your website for free, but you will use a subdomain of our domain (for example yourusername.websitebuilder.com), which will most probably not suit your needs, as the url will be ugly, it is not SEO friendly and you want attention to your website only, decoupled from the company that provided you with the tool to create it.

All of those platforms will offer you to connect a domain you own or buy this domain from them. This option of course brings montly/yearly fees with it.

### Choose your name wisely

This is a very important step! The name should be catchy, easy to remember and short.

### Ways of buying domain names

There are 2 ways of buying domain names
1. Using domain name providers: I recommend using ``GoDaddy``
2. Using the website builder platform as a provider of your domain name

## 2. Pick a Website builder platform

---

Website builders are a great option if you want to create a website from scratch that will be with an awesome design, responsive (people can view it from their browser or their mobile devices) and SEO friendly. Using those tools can get you up and running for a very small amount of time. 
There are a lot of options out there, but we're going to review the top 3 that are easiest to use.

So lets start.

### [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/omega23/)

1. WordPress integration - Yes
    <br />
    - Wordpress is basically built in - with a few clicks you create a wordpress website, and you will be able to choose from all the design templates, plugins and other tools that can be used for the platform.
2. Server uptime: Impressive **99.98%** uptime
3. Number of websites:

    - The pricing is very good for the services you would get. Normally when you start, you would most probably want to start with ```Shared Hosting``` with a ```Basic Plan``` and upgrade in future when you need more space, or you may want to host more websites on their platform.
